# Node.Js Learning

## About Node.Js
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Typically, JavaScript is used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write Command Line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.

## Personal Objectives
My goal with learning node.js during summer vacation is to upgrade my back-end developer skills and get more familiar with JavaScript, a language that gains more power and influencer everyday and it is important for me as a Software Engineering student to master tools like that.
